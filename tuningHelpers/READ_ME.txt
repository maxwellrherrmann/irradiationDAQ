READ ME for the tuningHelpers directory:

This directory contains two helpful bash scripts:
-LuigiGaioniProcedure.sh
-CreatePDFRoot.sh

LuigiGaioniProcedure.sh is designed to be run while you are in the CROC directory(CROC_##), and you must have this directory (tuningHelpers) copied into the CROC directory.
This script requires that CROC.xml, RD53B.toml, and RD53BTools.toml files have already been made and are in the CROC_## directory.
The tdac.csv files used are 336 rows by 432 columns of values in comma deliminated csv format.
The RD53B.toml file currently need to have the presets for LDAC and BIAS already set, something like:
"
[Registers]
DAC_LDAC_LIN = 130
DAC_PREAMP_L_LIN = 200
DAC_PREAMP_R_LIN = 200
DAC_PREAMP_TL_LIN = 200
DAC_PREAMP_TR_LIN = 200
DAC_PREAMP_T_LIN = 200
DAC_PREAMP_M_LIN = 200
"

LuigiGaioniProcedure.sh will go through all of the combinations of TDAC(0,16,31), LDAC(130,150,170,190), and BIAS(200,250,300) performing a RegReader command to ensure the LDAC and BIAS values have infact been changed, followed by a ThresholdScan.
To run script you must be outiside the tuningHelpers directory but inside CROC_## so when you run the script your command should look like:
"./tuningHelpers/LuigiGaioniProcedure.sh [Optional_destination_path]"
To exit mid run use CTRL C

The Optional_destination_path is the path to the directory you would like the results files and folders to be sent. If non is given it will default to a directory "Luigi_Gaioni_Procedure_Results_m_d_y_T"

The resulting file structure will be:
-destination_path:
	-BIAS###_TDAC_##_LDAC###:
		-Console_Log_BIAS###_TDAC##_LDAC###.txt
		-Current_Registers_BIAS###_TDAC##_LDAC###.txt
		-Noise_Dist_BIAS###_TDAC##_LDAC###.pdf
		-S_Curve_BIAS###_TDAC##_LDAC###.pdf
		-Threshold_Dist_BIAS###_TDAC##_LDAC###.pdf
		-ThresholdScan:
			-config:
				-enable.csv
				-RD53B.toml
				-RD53BTools.toml
				-tdac.csv
			-results.root
	-...(More BIAS##_TDAC_##_LDAC_### folders)


CreatePDFRoot.sh is an optional script which you may not ned to use, but if fore some reason LuigiGaioniProcedure.sh does create the root files with the resuls but an error occurs Create PDFRoot.sh can create the PDFs after the fact from the root files.

To run this bash you can run it from anywhere but it only works on directories created by "LuigiGaioniProcedure.sh". You will need to run:
"./CreatePDFRoot.sh [Required results path]"
the "Required results path" is the path to the results folder used by "LuigiGaioniProcedure.sh".


This directory  also contains required files for the LuigiGaioniProcedure.sh script:
-tdac0.csv
-tdac16.csv
-tdac31.csv
-macro.C

The tdac#.csv files are required to change the tdac for the CROC before we run the ThresholdScan

The macro.C file is used to create the PDFs from the results root files generated by the ThresholdScan.
